# Python-for-Data-Science

## Overview
First, and foremost, you'll learn how to conduct data science by learning how to analyze data.  That includes knowing how to import data, explore it, analyze it, learn from it, visualize it, and ultimately generate easily shareable reports.  We'll also introduce you to two powerful areas of data analysis: machine learning and natural language processing.

To conduct data analysis, you'll learn a collection of powerful, open-source, tools including:

* Python
* Jupyter notebooks
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Sci-kit Learn
* NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
* And many other tools!
And you won't be learning these tools in isolation.  You will learn these tools all within the context of solving compelling data science problems.

## Learning Objectives
* Basic process of data science
* Python & Jupyter notebooks
* An applied understanding of how to manipulate and analyze uncurated datasets
* Basic statistical analysis and machine learning methods
* How to effectively visualize results
